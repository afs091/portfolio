**Problem:**

Copy Number Variations (CNVs)—duplications or deletions of genomic regions—play a major role in neurodevelopmental disorders such as Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD).  
Although SFARI Gene aggregates CNV data from global ASD studies, the resource is distributed as **unstructured, heterogeneous text files** with inconsistent terms and implicit inter-record relationships. This lack of standardization prevented **computational analysis, large-scale integration, and hypothesis generation**. 

**Solution:**

We designed a **structured ETL workflow** to transform SFARI CNV data into queryable and extensible databases:
1. **Relational database (MySQL):** Integrated harmonized CNV calls, participant metadata, and gene/GO annotations (via Ensembl Biomart).
2. **Graph database (Neo4j):** Encoded biological relationships (*gene ↔ diagnosis*, *CNV ↔ participant*) to enable network-based analytics.
3. **Data normalization & curation:** Regex-based harmonization of terms, genome build standardization (GRCh38/hg38), and **explicit schema design** to ensure scalability.

**Impact:**

- Generated a **knowledge base of 68,811 patient–CNV associations** mapped across 28,717 individuals.
- Enabled **hypothesis generation** and efficient queries of patterns previously hidden in unstructured text.
- Created a **modular framework** extendable to external omics datasets (e.g., transcriptomics, proteomics).
- Contributed an **open science resource** used by the community (800+ downloads).

#### 2.1.2. Dopaminergic Networks and Diagnosis Classification in Autism Spectrum Disorder and Developmental Delay

*Complex network analysis and machine learning for disentangling dopaminergic mechanisms in ASD and DD*

**Highlights:**
- Built **multi-layer networks** (genes, GO terms, participants) to study dopaminergic imbalance in ASD vs. DD.  
- Identified **four disrupted dopaminergic mechanisms** in ASD versus a more unified dopaminergic pattern in DD.  
- Achieved **85.2% classification accuracy** distinguishing ASD from DD using Random Forests (features: 117 genes / 62 GO terms).  
- Proposed a **biology-driven ontological feature space** that compactly generalizes across genetic variability.  

<details>
<summary>📖 Read More</summary>

**Problem:**  
The neurobiological underpinnings of autism spectrum disorder (ASD) remain unclear, partly due to its **phenotypic and genetic heterogeneity**. While dopaminergic dysfunction is a strong candidate mechanism, no framework existed for functionally comparing dopaminergic gene dosage effects in **ASD vs. Developmental Delay (DD)**.  

**Solution:**  
We applied **complex network analysis** to SFARI CNV datasets in order to capture dopaminergic disruptions:  
1. Constructed **Gene Dosage Networks** linking duplications/deletions of dopamine-related genes to participants.  
2. Built **GO-based Networks** (biological processes, molecular functions, cellular localization of the dopaminergic synapse).  
3. Analyzed hubs, modularity, and community structures to reveal disease-specific subnetworks.  
4. Trained **Random Forest models** on network-derived feature vectors to classify ASD vs. DD.

**Impact:**  
- Found that **ASD networks fractionated into four distinct disrupted mechanisms** (receptor binding, dopamine metabolism, synaptic physiology, neuronal differentiation).  
- DD presented **a more unified low-modularity dopaminergic profile**, highlighting a key biological distinction from ASD.  
- Achieved **85.18% (±1.1%) accuracy** in classifying ASD vs. DD (test set: 790 individuals), surpassing prior genetics-only studies and nearing imaging-based approaches.  
- Demonstrated that only **62 GO-derived features** achieved similar performance to gene features, supporting the value of a **compact ontology-driven feature space**.  
- Advances the case for **knowledge-based machine learning pipelines** in neurodevelopmental diagnoses.

#### 2.1.3. Graph-Native Machine Learning for Node Classification with Participant Similarity Networks using Dopaminergic Features

*Using dopaminergic genetic similarity graphs to classify ASD vs. DD participants with graph-native ML*

**Highlights:**
- Built **participant similarity networks** (N=2343; ASD=1288, DD=1055) from dopaminergic CNVs + GO terms.  
- Constructed three graph types: **genetic similarity (gs)**, **GO-term similarity (gos)**, and **combined (ggos)**.  
- Demonstrated that **graph embedding features outperformed centrality metric features** for classification tasks.  
- Achieved **>84% accuracy** in ASD vs DD classification with embedding-based Random Forests.  
- Revealed **finer subgroup structures in ASD**, while GO terms grouped participants into broader communities.  

<details>
<summary>📖 Read More</summary>

**Problem:**  
ASD and DD are **multifactorial disorders** with **highly heterogeneous genetic and functional profiles**. Individual genetic variants contribute weakly, and shared clinical labels often mask divergent molecular mechanisms. Traditional ML treats participants as **independent datapoints**, missing the **networked relationships** that emerge from shared dopaminergic disruptions. A graph-native approach is needed to capture these relational patterns for better classification and subgroup discovery.  

**Solution:**  
- Constructed a **graph database** linking participants → dopamine genes → GO terms.  
- Computed pairwise participant similarity vectors based on gene and/or GO features.  
- Built three similarity networks: **gs, gos, ggos**.  
- Extracted node-level features via **centrality** & **graph embeddings (node2vec)**.  
- Trained **Random Forest classifiers** with 5-fold CV to predict ASD vs DD.  

**Impact:**  
- Showed that network representation strongly shapes participant clustering:  
  - **gs:** fragmented into 48 highly modular subgroups (fine-grained genetic signal).  
  - **gos:** only 8 broader communities (functional similarity).  
  - **ggos:** intermediate (12 modules; compact yet heterogeneous).  
- **Similarity trends:** ASD–ASD pairs most similar across all networks, DD/DD and ASD/DD weaker.  
- **Classification results:**  
  - Centrality features ~78–80% accuracy.  
  - Embedding features **>84% accuracy**, with ASD precision (88.7%) and DD recall (90.2%) strongest in gs network.  
  - Integration of genetic + functional features improved robustness and balance.  
- Paves the way for **multi-omics + clinical graph integration** in GNML pipelines for ASD diagnostics.

#### 2.1.4. Serotonergic Networks: Differentiating ASD and DD

*Exploring serotonergic CNVs and pathway signatures to classify neurodevelopmental disorders*

**Highlights:**
- Investigated **serotonergic gene dosage effects** (CNVs) in ASD (Autism Spectrum Disorder) and DD (Developmental Delay).  
- Constructed **gene- and GO-based networks** to analyze serotonergic mechanisms.  
- Found **ASD = 6 genetic clusters** (5 receptor-related) vs. **DD = 2 clusters** (more homogeneous).  
- Random Forest classifiers achieved **85.6% accuracy** (serotonergic features alone), rising to **88.6%** when combined with dopaminergic features.  
- GO-based features delivered comparable accuracy **with fewer inputs**, showing efficiency.  

<details>
<summary>📖 Read More</summary>

**Problem:**  
Differentiating ASD and DD remains **challenging**, as both share overlapping clinical features and partially overlapping genetic backgrounds. Serotonergic mechanisms are known to impact **social cognition and neurodevelopment**, but their **distinct roles in ASD vs DD** remain unclear. Existing approaches fail to disentangle how **different gene alterations may converge on the same serotonergic pathways** while still leaving distinct disease signatures.  

**Solution:**  
- Extracted CNVs from the **SFARI Gene CNV Module** related to **serotonergic signaling**.  
- Built participant–gene–GO term graphs to capture **dosage effects and functional annotations**.  
- Identified **hub nodes and subnetworks**, revealing distinct serotonergic signatures for ASD vs DD.  
- Deployed **Random Forest pipelines** with feature reduction (wrapper method) and repeated 100 validation cycles.  

**Impact:**  
- Revealed a **heterogeneous but pathway-convergent serotonergic profile in ASD**, with multiple receptor-related clusters.  
- DD participants showed **greater genetic homogeneity**, reflected in fewer serotonergic clusters.  
- Achieved high diagnostic accuracy (85–89%), underscoring **serotonergic CNVs as robust classifiers**.  
- Integration with dopaminergic features improved performance, supporting **cross-pathway mechanistic overlap**.  
- Suggests serotonin may play a **more direct causal role than dopamine** in differentiating ASD, highlighting **potential biomarkers and therapeutic targets**.
